How would you use this great new tool? As always contact me on twitter, in the comments, or send a smoke signal into the ether and let’s build tools for teachers!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New Google Slides Service","date":null,"description":null},"fields":{"date":"Mon Oct 02 2017 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"summer-vacation-map/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Summer Vacation Map"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"the-calendar-and-the-date-object/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Calendar and the Date Object"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"efec6367-fc8b-5ff0-89b1-f306bdc209f9","previousPostId":"05c277d3-1593-5b83-a5d5-4b2c544fe3aa","nextPostId":"8f2b14b7-1f7a-5609-b3b7-956ce2a884e5"}},
