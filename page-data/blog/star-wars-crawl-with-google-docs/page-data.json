I wanted to demonstrate a way to incorporate Google Apps Script with a project on Google Sites. This is a super basic example, and all of the coding has been done for us!</p>\n<p>All you need to do is fork the project on Github and pull in the code with the Google Apps Script Extension that I use. I demonstrate how to do that in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf4zZpVcrhA\">this video</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, you can manually do it by copy and pasting the code. I don’t recommend this way, because it is easy to mess up! Also, why do things manually when you can automate them???</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rheajt/Star-Wars-Crawl\">Github Repository</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Star Wars Crawl with Google Docs","date":null,"description":null},"fields":{"date":"Fri Jan 12 2018 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"adding-rows-to-a-sheet-from-a-webapp/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Adding Rows to a Sheet from a WebApp"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"Google-Forms-Are-Boring/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google Forms Are Boring"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3c95c365-1a32-5716-bf26-741bcc213e9e","previousPostId":"a50ff880-a629-5d7d-9028-9e12b887ff97","nextPostId":"2d6f0710-d5d6-58a3-9b25-6529f8e698ad"}},
