I wanted to demonstrate a way to incorporate Google Apps Script with a project on Google Sites. This is a super basic example, and all of the coding has been done for us!</p>\n<p>All you need to do is fork the project on Github and pull in the code with the Google Apps Script Extension that I use. I demonstrate how to do that in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf4zZpVcrhA\">this video</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, you can manually do it by copy and pasting the code. I don’t recommend this way, because it is easy to mess up! Also, why do things manually when you can automate them???</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rheajt/Star-Wars-Crawl\">Github Repository</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Star Wars Crawl with Google Docs","date":null,"description":null},"fields":{"date":"Fri Jan 12 2018 08:00:00 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"Google-Forms-Are-Boring/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Google Forms Are Boring"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"build-a-zillow-pricing-custom-function/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Build a Zillow Pricing Custom Function"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a24ed4b5-9b26-5d9b-b3db-fe665b4fd8e6","previousPostId":"0c192a5b-3831-57ac-82d1-45dd7b9f8dab","nextPostId":"785de5bc-f198-52db-a8c3-d6a46360acf9"}},
