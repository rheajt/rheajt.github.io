The\n                Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection\n                agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators\n                of websites and online services must do to protect children's\n                privacy and safety online.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13\n                years old.\n            </p>\n\n            <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>\n\n            <p>\n                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of\n                privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include\n                have played a significant role in the development of data\n                protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair\n                Information Practice Principles and how they should be\n                implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws\n                that protect personal information.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will\n                take the following responsive action, should a data breach\n                occur:\n            </p>\n            <p>We will notify the users via in-site notificatio within 7 business days.</p>\n\n            <p>\n                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires\n                that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable\n                rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere\n                to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals\n                have enforceable rights against data users, but also that\n                individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to\n                investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.\n            </p>\n\n            <h5>CAN SPAM Act</h5>\n\n            <p>\n                The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial\n                email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives\n                recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to\n                them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other\n                    requests or questions\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Process orders and to send information and updates\n                    pertaining to orders.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Send you additional information related to your product\n                    and/or service\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>\n            <ul>\n                <li>\n                    Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable\n                    way.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Include the physical address of our business or site\n                    headquarters.\n                </li>\n                <li>\n                    Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance,\n                    if one is used.\n                </li>\n                <li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>\n                <li>\n                    Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom\n                    of each email.\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n\n            <p>\n                If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving\n                future emails, you can follow the instructions at the bottom of\n                each email. and we will promptly remove you fromALL\n                correspondence.\n            </p>\n\n            <h5>Contacting Us</h5>\n\n            <p>\n                If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy, you\n                may contact us using the information below.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n                <a href=\"mailto:jordan@jordanrhea.com\">jordanrhea.com</a>\n            </p>\n        </Layout>\n    );\n};\n\nexport default PrivacyPage;\n\nexport const pageQuery = graphql`\n    query {\n        site {\n            siteMetadata {\n                title\n            }\n        }\n    }\n`;\n"],"names":["_ref","data","location","siteTitle","site","siteMetadata","title","React","Layout","Seo","href"],"sourceRoot":""}
