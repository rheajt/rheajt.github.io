    text: Jordan helped us understand how to use data we collected for our WASC review in a way that helped us understand better our challenges and successes as a school. Through the use of Power BI, we were able to mine data in a more profound way to give us answers we were seeking about our student and teacher well-being, professional development an d experiential education program.
    excerpt: Jordan was indispensable for helping us collect and use data to tell our story as a school. Generating the WASC report required a lot of collaboration, and it was brought together with the help of Jordan's data prowess.
