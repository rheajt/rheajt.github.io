Powerschool contains all of the data that your staff is generating and using on a daily basis. It only makes sense to use that data to inform the decisions you are making on a daily basis.

Often, it makes sense to build tools that leverage this data directly into the other digital spaces where you are spending time. In this case I needed a way to take Powerschool schedules to create Outlook Calendar events.
