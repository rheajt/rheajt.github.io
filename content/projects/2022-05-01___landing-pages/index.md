    text: Jordan has supported our school over the past two years on data and systems project. He is keen to connect with users, understand their pain points, and develop solutions that will help to improve the flow and function within the school. His educational background allows him to relate to the day-to-day needs of a school to come up with solutions that actually work and improve the operations of the school. In particular he has used Sharepoint to build a school-wide communication hub, Power Platforms to build student support systems and PowerBI to visualize school data to inform teaching, learning and school decisions, amongst many other projects. I can truly say that Jordan has made our school a better place through his efforts.
