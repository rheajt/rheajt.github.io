This project was suggested by [Desiree Alexander](https://twitter.com/educatoralex) who felt that she was getting too many emails from various groups that she was involved with.

Instead of unsubscribing from a potentially useful community, I thought it would be more useful to summarize those emails and send a single document.

You have to watch the video to get a better explanation on how to use this tool! It involves configuring your labels and filters in your inbox. Can you think of a better way to organize your inbox? I think instead of creating a document it would be nice to get a single email containing links. Send me some messages if you want to see this update!

The code for this project is available at [Github](https://github.com/rheajt/email-summarizer) and the project may still be on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emailsummarize/kmmcjkpadeamefpbedonjghlihdiefln)
