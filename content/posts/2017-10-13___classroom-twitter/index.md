## What if it was possible to have students send tweets about the classroom without having every student sign up for a twitter account? What if it was possible for you, the teacher, to screen the tweets before they were sent?

Great news! It is possible and that is exactly what we are doing in this video series!

I had to break this project up into several parts so please stick through it. There are a number of topics that I am going to cover in the series, and they will all help someone learning JavaScript to understand how it all fits together.

The library that we use is [Twitter Lib](https://github.com/airhadoken/twitter-lib). There is some better documentation from the developer on [his Github pages blog](http://airhadoken.github.io/2015/06/29/twitter-lib-explained.html).

I really want to see what kinds of Projects teachers are going to create with this code. If you find it helpful, tweet me from you classroom twitter account!
