This is a tool suggested by my third favorite librarian in the entire world, Liz Brouwer! She wanted a way to help students find books in specific genres.

She created a quiz in the style of Buzzfeed style of quizzing and she generated a bunch of lists of books that she could recommend to students that were available in the school library.

We used the API provided by Goodreads in order to display book covers and book data. This all gets distributed into students drives in the form of a document that has them complete simple tasks.

What else would you like to see to make this project easier for students to use? Let me know in the comments below!

The code is available on my [Github](https://github.com/rheajt/library-genre-quiz-app)
