Contact Creator was a tool suggested on the Apps Script for Education forums.

I am still working on the "Student Data Portal" from a previous video. I wanted to show you how you can use multiple services. I decided to stop the recording before I made it work with the Contacts service. Can you figure out how I can fix that? I am posting a link to the code below.

Leave me comments so I can figure out how to better help teachers! This project needs updating, so if you want to see that or have interest, you can do that in the comments also!
