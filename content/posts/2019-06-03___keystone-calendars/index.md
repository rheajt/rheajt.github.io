A year and change ago I wrote some code that would help synchronize a 6-day calendar with a 5 day week. The goal is to remove the paper planners from the list of tools that students need to carry around with them all day.

I coded a server where an administrator can upload all of the schedules. Then when a user logs in, they can build their specific schedule into their own Outlook calendar.

The app itself is powered by `graphql-yoga` with a frontend simply styled by a bootstrap theme. I used Apollo Client to run the queries on the frontend. The school is in the process of moving all of their schedules to a system called `Power School` so I set up a very simple temporary solution that can be replaced later.

The end result ends up looking like this:
