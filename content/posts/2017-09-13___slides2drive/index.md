This tool was the brainchild of my friend [Dee Lanier](https://twitter.com/deelanier). He wanted a way to take all of the slides from a slidedeck and save them onto drive as images.

This tool does just that, and as I found out later it does the exact opposite as a Chrome Extension that takes images and builds slidedecks with them.

If you have suggestions for this tool please leave me some comments below! The entire point of this tool is to create tools that solve teacher problems, so if you see a problem that isn't being solved by this tool let me know!

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/rheajt/slides2drive)

This project is probably still on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slides2drive/hoaphdpaeigjjogjkdicgpmepdolkcbh)
