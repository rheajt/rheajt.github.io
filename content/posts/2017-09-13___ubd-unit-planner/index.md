Ever had a document template that you had to repeat every few weeks and that were very different, but also similar? This was a project I tackled when I was first learning to code. I tried to put all of my objectives into a simple, repeatable format to save myself time when it came time to write out a new unit plan.

## Using the unit by design template to plan units.

One of the very first coding Projects I ever embarked on. When I was just beginning to learn Javascript on (<i class="fa fa-freecodecamp"></i>) freeCodeCamp I wanted a practice project. At the same time, I needed a way to streamline my own lesson planning.

This was the project that I came up with. I don't think it is halfbad!

The code is available on [Github](https://github.com/rheajt/ubd-unit-planner)
