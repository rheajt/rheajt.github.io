## I love [ClassDojo](https://classdojo.com) and so do primary students!

In this project my goal was to make it easier for me to track attendance data from ClassDojo in a spreadsheet. Since, I hate the idea of copy/pasting or manually transferring that info each day, I had to learn how to work with Chrome Extensions.

## There is no better way to engage your classroom at the beginning of the period than to show your student's names with little monster avatars.

However, I needed a way to share the attendance that I log in the application with the administration at my school.

That is how this tool was born. Just setup a few email addresses and log into your class on [ClassDojo](https://classdojo.com) to activate the extension.

This Chrome Extension is available on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/classdojo-extension/mbhcppckcncdempkomncfipbddlkofio)
