## Social media isn't just for sharing pictures with your friends.

## Developers can even share code with their friends!

In this video I am demonstrating how to use a really cool extension for Google Chrome that allows you to sync Projects with your [Github](https://github.com) account. If you don't have an account yet, sign up and follow me! I have a number of Projects that I want to share with teacher/makers such as yourself!

So sign up, follow me, and start developing your ideas into tools that we can all use!
