This project was born from the brain child of Melissa Oliver and her passion project, [to create accessibility in classrooms](http://www.createaccessibility.com/).

Teachers do not always want their students to publish videos directly to YouTube. There are a variety of reasons for this, but it is a shame because YouTube has an incredible tool for captioning videos.

This project was designed around recreating that tool for videos that are hosted on Google Drive!

The code for this project is [on Github](https://github.com/rheajt/caption-creator-for-google-drive) and I think you can still find it on the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caption-creator-for-drive/pgaidpkchpikpgiikkldcbeppcbilmag)

If you have interest in me MASSIVELY updating this project and discussing more about productivity... comment below so I know there is interest!
