Shunyi Today is my first attempt to scale out a full-stack graphql application. I started with the brand new Wes Bos course [Advanced React](https://advancedreact.com) and then started from scratch doing basically the same thing with a focus on the little area of Beijing where I live.

I then wanted to practice again, so I tried to build in functionality from a Node application. By this point it is almost a feasible application!
