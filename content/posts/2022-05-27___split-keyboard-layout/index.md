## Fixing the elbow and wrist pain for me was as simple as changing my keyboard.

I have been using the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) since 2020. It has helped me immensely just with the pains in my arms. Beyond that, it has helped me move around the terminal with the speed of light.

<div style="padding-top: 60%; position: relative;">
	<iframe src="https://configure.zsa.io/embed/ergodox-ez/layouts/APnMB/latest/0" style="border: 0; height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%"></iframe>
</div>

This is a constantly changing layout. I have been making small changes constantly and I'm always trying to make refinements. I am not fully on board with splitting the `[]` `()` `{}` characters across the split. However, I have not found a solution that is acceptable to me yet. This works and I find myself typing pretty fast!
