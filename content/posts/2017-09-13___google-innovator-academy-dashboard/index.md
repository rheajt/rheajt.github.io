I was accepted into the Google Innovator Academy in May of 2016 as part of the [#COL16](https://twitter.com/hashtag/COL16) cohort. Since my project has been all about using Javascript to enhance teaching, I thought I would build a Chrome extension for the cohort.

I wanted to embed a calendar in there and provide a task list. I wired it up to the Task API provided by Google and tied that into the [TODO MVC Framework](http://todomvc.com).

I want to update this to streamline it a little more. Do you have any ideas for a more useful implementation? Maybe if the background was transparent so it wouldn't interfere with your theme...
