## Cloud functions! Easy way to process HTTP requests without setting up an entire server. Plus they are cheap! Plus you can use any language! Plus everyone hosts them!

I use lots of Google services in my projects, but I am certainly not married to the Google platform. They don't pay my bills, I just like to use their services!

That being said, here are some links to augment my demonstration:
