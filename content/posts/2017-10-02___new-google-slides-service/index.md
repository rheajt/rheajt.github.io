Google Apps Script now provides a simple way to integrate with slide decks!

One of the problems that I am noticing is that there are no triggers associated with the SlidesApp service yet. It would be great if those start to get introduced. For example, if there is a trigger when a presentation starts you could create functions that run at the time of a presentation and play music or start a timer.

Check out my video above and let me know what you think! How would you use this great new tool? As always contact me on twitter, in the comments, or send a smoke signal into the ether and let's build tools for teachers!
