        Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not
        print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not
        to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books”
        but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found
        useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the
        web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this
        particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design
        goal, because any project should present their information as best suits
        their particular circumstances.
